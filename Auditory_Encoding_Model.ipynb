        "When a neuron in the auditory cortex receives information about a sound that's passed through early auditory areas, how does that neuron transform and represent that sound? A spectro temporal receptive field (STRF) is a model that describes neural function as a filter that can be used to predict neural outputs given a stimulus. An STRF describes spectral and temporal aspects of a stimulus spectrogram that will lead to a stronger neural response.\n",

How do we *swap* the *axes* of our array? `np.swapaxes()` is how.
